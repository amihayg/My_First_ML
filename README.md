My_First_ML
In this project I learned about ML classification with iris data set
First I learned how to use Matplot lib to present the iris data and its real calcification by color
Next I learned 2 calcification method with sklearn
  KNeighborsClassifier 
  DecisionTreeClassifier 
  
 The first one predict using the closest point(can define the number of calculation point)
 The second one(magickly :) ) creates a step by step yes/no tree to define what category is the right one
 
I learned how to use Git and upload my code for sharing and great code version control
